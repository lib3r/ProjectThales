A substantial concern leading to global market instability was the long-term monetary shortfall in Greece leading up to the Greek default on June 30 on an International Monetary Fund loan payment but the decisive trigger for the end of the 2009-15 bull market was China's stock market crash that began that same June.

Causes
---
In the year leading up to the crash in China, encouraged by state-owned media, enthusiastic individual investors inflated the stock market bubble through mass amounts of investments in stocks often using borrowed money, exceeding the rate of economic growth and profits of the companies they were investing in.


However, investor concerns over a perceived impending end to the U.S. Federal Reserve policy of quantitative easing played a major role in the ongoing downturn, along with the collapse of oil prices, which chokes off investment in emerging markets, causing resonating negative global financial effects. Other issues include China devaluing it's currency and their perceived clumsiness especially in light of Chinese governmental efforts to stem the selloff.


2015 Chinese Bubble
---

The Chinese stock market crash began with the popping of the stock market bubble on 12 June 2015.

1. By 8–9 July 2015, the Shanghai stock market had fallen 30 percent over three weeks as 1,400 companies, or more than half listed, filed for a trading halt in an attempt to prevent further losses.

2. From June 12 to August 24, the Shanghai Composite index shed 38% of its value.

3. After three stable weeks the Shanghai index fell again on 27 July by 8.5 percent, marking the largest fall since 2007

4. On 11 August, two months after the crash, the People's Bank of China devalued the renminbi by 1.86 percent to CN¥6.2298 per US dollar.

5. On 14 August, the central bank devalued it to CN¥6.3975 per US dollar

Major aftershocks occurred around July 27 and August 24's "Black Monday."

Government response
---
The Chinese government enacted many measures to stem the tide of the crash.

* Regulators limited short selling under threat of arrest.

* Large mutual funds and pension funds pledged to buy more stocks.

* The government stopped initial public offerings.

* The government also provided cash to brokers to buy shares, backed by central-bank cash.

* Because the Chinese markets mostly comprise individuals and not institutional funds (80 percent of investors in China are individuals), state-run media continued to persuade its citizens to purchase more stocks.

* In addition, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) imposed a six-month ban on stockholders owning more than 5 percent of a company's stock from selling those stocks, resulting in a 6 percent rise in stock markets.

* Further, around 1,300 total firms, representing 45 percent of the stock market, suspended the trading of stocks starting on 8 July.

First plunge in the States
---
Starting on August 18 (August 19 for the Dow) the selloff set a trend.

* The Dow fell 33 points, (0.19%) and grew in momentum: -0.8% on August 19, -2.1% on August 20 and -3.12% (Dow) and -3.5% (Nasdaq) on August 21.

* The Dow Jones fell 888 points during a two-day period, 1300 points from August 18–21.

* August 21, 2015, falling 531 points (3.12%) on that day

Black Monday
---
On Monday, August 24, world stock markets were down substantially, wiping out all gains made in 2015, with interlinked drops in commodities such as oil, which hit a six-year price low, copper, and most of Asian currencies, but the Japanese Yen, losing value against the United States Dollar.

* With the stock market plunge on Monday, an estimated ten trillion dollars had been wiped off the books on global markets since June 3

* The 8.49 percent drop in China on August 24 was termed "Black Monday" by the Chinese state media. The term gained wide usage in the next 48 hours

* In Europe, the main stock markets dropped at least 3% on August 24. The FTSE lost -4.4% (£78bn) but upon opening on August 25, shot up 116 points (1.97%).

* The Dow Jones opened 1,000 points lower on August 24, but gained nearly half of it back in the first 30 minutes
